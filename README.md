### Non-parametric Statistics

#### Bootstrap

The bootstrap method is a statistical technique for estimating statistics about a population from a small sample by resampling. This python code could, for any statistic, give an estimation of Standard Error, improve the point estimation, and provide a interval estimation. More explanation could be found in the annotations within the "Bootstrap.py" file.
